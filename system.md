# Quantitative Intuition Trading System

## 1. System Overview

### Philosophy
This system is designed to bridge the gap between human trader intuition and machine learning, leveraging a suite of advanced Smart Money Concepts (SMC) indicators and a mathematically rigorous risk model. The goal is to create an agent that learns to trade like an expert discretionary trader—using context, multi-timeframe signals, and adaptive risk—without relying on hardcoded rules or static thresholds.

### High-Level Architecture
- **Data Pipeline**: Ingests raw OHLCV data, computes a rich set of multi-timeframe SMC indicators, and produces a comprehensive feature matrix for model training and live inference.
- **Feature Engineering**: All indicators (IT Foundation, SMC Core, Breaker Signals, ICT, etc.) are computed across 15s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, and 4h timeframes, with temporal and cross-indicator features.
- **Model Training**: A deep learning model (e.g., TFT) is trained to learn entry, exit, and position management intuition from historical data, using the full indicator suite as input.
- **Rule Extraction**: After training, interpretable rules are extracted from the model to provide transparency and hybrid logic.
- **Trading Agent**: In live trading, the agent combines model predictions and extracted rules to make context-aware, dynamic trading decisions.
- **Risk Engine**: All position sizing and risk management is handled by a custom adaptive risk model based on Bayesian Kelly, volatility scaling, and stochastic drawdown control.

### Core Design Principles
- **Intuition Learning**: The model learns to trade like a human, not by following static rules, but by internalizing patterns from the full indicator suite and multi-timeframe context.
- **No Hardcoded Thresholds**: All entry/exit/management logic is learned from data; the system adapts to changing market regimes.
- **Multi-Timeframe Context**: Every decision is informed by indicator states across all relevant timeframes, capturing both microstructure and macro context.
- **Dynamic Position Management**: The agent can adjust stops, take profits, and exit early based on evolving indicator states and learned patterns.
- **Mathematical Risk Control**: Position sizing and risk are governed by a research-grade, adaptive risk engine, ensuring robust compounding and drawdown control.
- **Interpretability**: Extracted rules and model diagnostics provide transparency into what the agent has learned and why it acts.

## 2. Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Raw Data Ingestion
- The system ingests raw OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) at the highest available resolution (typically 15s bars for BTC/USD).
- Data is validated for completeness, correct types, and absence of NaNs.
- Timezones are normalized to UTC, and all indices are aligned for multi-timeframe processing.

### 2.2 Indicator Computation
- **Philosophy**: Indicators are chosen to reflect the real-world intuition and context used by expert traders, not just generic technical analysis. The suite includes:
  - **IT Foundation**: EMA alignment, Fair Value Gaps, Multi-TF trend snapshot
  - **SMC Core**: Market structure, order blocks, fair value gaps, liquidity sweeps, change of character (ChoCh), break of structure (BoS)
  - **Breaker Signals**: 22+ breakout and reversal signals
  - **ICT Smart Money Trades**: ATR, pivots, market structure shifts, FVGs
  - **Liquidity Swings, TR Reality, PVSRA, BB OB Engine, Sessions**: Additional context and microstructure
- Each indicator is implemented as a pure function that takes a DataFrame of OHLCV and returns a DataFrame of quantified features.

### 2.3 Multi-Timeframe Feature Construction
- For each indicator, features are computed across all relevant timeframes: 15s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h.
- Features are aligned and joined so that, for any given 15s bar, the agent has access to the current state of all indicators at all timeframes.
- Temporal features are engineered to capture momentum, persistence, and recent changes in indicator states (e.g., diff, rolling mean, signal persistence).
- Cross-indicator features are created to capture relationships (e.g., SMC structure + Breaker block + IT alignment).

### 2.4 Feature Matrix for Model Training
- The final feature matrix is a wide, tabular dataset where each row is a 15s bar and each column is a feature from an indicator at a specific timeframe, or a temporal/cross feature.
- This matrix is used for both model training (supervised learning) and live inference.
- All features are float32 or int8 for memory efficiency.
- Feature selection is performed automatically during model training (e.g., via LightGBM/TFT feature importance or attention weights).

### 2.5 Why This Works
- By providing the model with the same multi-timeframe, multi-indicator context that a human trader uses, we enable it to learn complex, intuitive patterns that are not accessible to single-timeframe or single-indicator systems.
- The system is not limited by hardcoded rules; it can discover subtle relationships and adapt to new regimes as the market evolves.

## 3. Indicator Suite: Quantified Intuition

### 3.1 IT Foundation
- **What it measures**: EMA alignment (20, 50, 200), active Fair Value Gaps (FVG), and multi-timeframe trend snapshots.
- **Why included**: Captures the core of trend-following and mean-reversion intuition. EMA alignment is a classic discretionary filter; FVGs highlight institutional inefficiencies; multi-TF trend gives context.
- **Contribution**: Allows the model to learn when trends are strong, when to fade moves, and when to expect reversals based on gap filling or trend exhaustion.

### 3.2 SMC Core (Smart Money Concepts)
- **What it measures**: Market structure (trend, swing, internal), order blocks (institutional zones), fair value gaps, liquidity sweeps, change of character (ChoCh), break of structure (BoS).
- **Why included**: SMC is the foundation of modern institutional trading. These features encode the "story" of price action: where smart money is active, where stops are clustered, and when the market regime is shifting.
- **Contribution**: Enables the model to learn to anticipate reversals, breakouts, and fakeouts, and to recognize when the market is transitioning between accumulation, manipulation, and distribution phases.

### 3.3 Breaker Signals
- **What it measures**: 22+ signals for breakouts, reversals, swing breaks, take profit levels, and more.
- **Why included**: These are the microstructure signals that a discretionary trader watches for confirmation or invalidation of a setup.
- **Contribution**: Gives the model the ability to "see" the same nuanced confirmations and warnings that a human would use to filter or time entries and exits.

### 3.4 ICT Smart Money Trades
- **What it measures**: ATR (volatility), large/daily/weekly pivots, market structure shifts (MSS), fair value gaps (FVGs).
- **Why included**: ICT concepts are widely used by professional traders to identify high-probability zones and volatility regimes.
- **Contribution**: Allows the model to learn to size stops and targets dynamically, to recognize when volatility is expanding or contracting, and to anchor trades to institutional levels.

### 3.5 Liquidity Swings
- **What it measures**: Swing highs/lows, liquidity grabs, stop runs.
- **Why included**: Liquidity is the fuel for all major moves. Identifying where stops are likely to be run is key to anticipating fakeouts and true breakouts.
- **Contribution**: Lets the model learn to avoid entering right before a stop hunt, or to fade moves that have just swept liquidity.

### 3.6 TR Reality Core
- **What it measures**: Trend strength, trend reversals, and reality checks on price action.
- **Why included**: Helps distinguish between real and fake trends, and between healthy and exhausted moves.
- **Contribution**: Gives the model a sense of when to hold for trend continuation and when to expect mean reversion.

### 3.7 PVSRA (Price, Volume, Supply, Resistance, Analysis)
- **What it measures**: Price/volume relationships, supply/demand zones, volume spikes.
- **Why included**: Volume is the "truth" behind price. PVSRA features help the model understand when moves are supported by real participation.
- **Contribution**: Enables the model to filter out low-quality signals and to size up when volume confirms the move.

### 3.8 BB OB Engine (Bollinger Bands Order Block)
- **What it measures**: Reversal zones, order blocks, and breakout points using Bollinger Bands.
- **Why included**: Combines volatility envelopes with institutional order flow, a powerful discretionary combo.
- **Contribution**: Lets the model learn to fade extremes, anticipate breakouts, and spot institutional footprints.

### 3.9 Sessions
- **What it measures**: Major trading sessions (London, New York, Tokyo), session-specific price action.
- **Why included**: Market behavior changes dramatically by session. Session features help the model adapt to time-of-day effects.
- **Contribution**: Allows the model to learn when to be aggressive (e.g., London open) and when to be defensive (e.g., Asia session).

## 4. Model Training & Intuition Learning

### 4.1 Philosophy: Learning Intuition, Not Rules
- The core philosophy is to let the model discover the patterns, relationships, and context that a skilled human trader would use—without imposing hardcoded rules or thresholds.
- The model is exposed to the same multi-timeframe, multi-indicator context as a discretionary trader, and is trained to predict optimal actions based on historical outcomes.
- This enables the model to learn subtle, non-linear, and regime-dependent behaviors that are impossible to capture with static logic.

### 4.2 Label Generation: Teaching the Model What Matters
- **Entry/Exit Labels**: Instead of simple buy/sell labels, the system generates rich labels:
  - Entry probability (should we enter?)
  - Entry direction (long/short)
  - Entry confidence (how strong is the setup?)
  - Position size multiplier (how aggressive to size?)
  - Take profit/stop loss distances (dynamic, not fixed)
  - Trailing stop aggressiveness
  - Early exit probability (should we exit before TP/SL?)
  - Expected hold duration
- **How labels are created**: Labels are derived from future price action, indicator changes, and trade outcomes, capturing the "intuition" of what would have worked best in hindsight.

### 4.3 Model Architecture: Multi-Output, Temporal, and Contextual
- **Model type**: Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) or similar deep learning model capable of handling multi-output, multi-horizon, and temporal dependencies.
- **Inputs**: The full feature matrix (all indicators, all timeframes, temporal/cross features).
- **Outputs**: Multiple heads for entry, exit, sizing, and management decisions.
- **Temporal learning**: The model learns not just from the current bar, but from sequences of indicator states, capturing momentum, persistence, and regime shifts.
- **Multi-output**: The model can simultaneously predict entry, exit, and management parameters, learning the relationships between them.

### 4.4 Training Process
- **Data split**: Walk-forward or time-series cross-validation to avoid lookahead bias.
- **Loss functions**: Custom loss functions for each output (e.g., binary cross-entropy for entry, regression for TP/SL distances).
- **Feature selection**: The model automatically learns which features matter most via attention or feature importance.
- **Regularization**: Dropout, early stopping, and other techniques to prevent overfitting.

### 4.5 Validation & Diagnostics
- **Backtesting**: The trained model is validated on unseen historical data, with full trade simulation (including slippage, fees, and risk model integration).
- **Diagnostics**: Feature importance, attention maps, and rule extraction are used to interpret what the model has learned.
- **Performance metrics**: Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, win rate, profit factor, and more.

### 4.6 Why This Works
- By letting the model learn from the same context a human uses, it can discover patterns that are too complex or subtle for rule-based systems.
- The model adapts to new regimes, learns to avoid overtrading, and can internalize "intuition" about when to be aggressive or defensive.

## 5. Trading Agent Logic

### 5.1 Overview: Context-Aware, Dynamic, and Non-Hardcoded
- The trading agent is designed to act like a skilled discretionary trader, but with the consistency and speed of automation.
- It combines model predictions (learned intuition) with extracted rules (for interpretability and hybrid logic).
- All decisions are made in context: the agent considers the current state of all indicators, all timeframes, and recent history before acting.

### 5.2 State Machine: Managing the Trading Lifecycle
- The agent operates as a state machine with the following states:
  - **IDLE**: No position, scanning for opportunities every 15 seconds.
  - **ANALYZING**: Evaluating whether current context justifies an entry, using model outputs and rules.
  - **ENTERING**: Executing an entry order, with dynamic TP/SL based on model outputs.
  - **MANAGING**: Actively managing an open position, adjusting TP/SL, trailing stops, and monitoring for early exit signals.
  - **EXITING**: Closing the position, either at TP/SL or due to a model/rule-based early exit.

### 5.3 Entry Logic: Model-Driven, Rule-Filtered
- The agent only considers entry if no position is open (no pyramiding).
- Entry is triggered if the model's entry probability and confidence are high, and the context (as seen by the indicators) is favorable.
- Extracted rules can override or filter model entries for additional safety or interpretability.
- Entry direction, size multiplier, and initial TP/SL distances are all set by the model's outputs.

### 5.4 Position Management: Dynamic and Adaptive
- **TP/SL Management**: Initial levels are set by the model, but are dynamically adjusted every 15 seconds based on new indicator states and model outputs.
- **Trailing Stops**: The model learns when and how aggressively to trail stops, based on context (e.g., strong momentum, new order block, session change).
- **Early Exit**: The agent monitors for early exit signals (e.g., change of character, break of structure, loss of alignment) as learned by the model or extracted from rules.
- **No Hardcoded Logic**: All adjustments are based on learned patterns, not static thresholds.

### 5.5 Risk Model Integration: Quantitative Edge Compounding
- All position sizing is handled by the adaptive risk model (see Section 6), which uses Bayesian Kelly sizing, volatility scaling, and drawdown control.
- The agent passes the model's confidence and context to the risk engine, which returns the optimal position size.
- This ensures that risk is always proportional to edge and adapts to changing market conditions.

### 5.6 Live Monitoring and State Management
- The agent maintains full state: current position, entry price, TP/SL, trailing stop, position age, and reason for entry/exit.
- All trades, adjustments, and exits are logged for later analysis and model retraining.
- The agent can be paused, resumed, or stopped at any time, and is robust to data or connection interruptions.

### 5.7 Why This Works
- By combining model-driven intuition, rule-based interpretability, and a mathematically rigorous risk engine, the agent can trade with both discretion and discipline.
- The system adapts in real time to new information, avoids overfitting to past regimes, and maintains robust risk control at all times.

## 6. Risk Model: Adaptive Edge Compounding

### 6.1 Overview
- The risk engine is a mathematically rigorous, research-grade framework for dynamic risk allocation under uncertainty.
- It combines Bayesian-updated Kelly sizing, volatility-weighted exposure scaling, conditional Martingale reinforcement, and stochastic drawdown control.
- The result is a compounding engine that adapts risk in real time, only increasing allocation when statistical edge is strong and drawdown pressure is low.

### 6.2 Bayesian Kelly Sizing
- **Classical Kelly**: For a known edge $e = p - q$ and reward-to-risk ratio $b$, the Kelly fraction is $f_{Kelly} = \frac{e}{b}$.
- **Posterior Shrinkage**: To account for uncertainty, $p$ is modeled as a Beta distribution. The posterior mean $\bar{p}_t$ is used to shrink the Kelly fraction when confidence is low:
  $$ \tilde{f}_t = \frac{2\bar{p}_t - 1}{b} $$
- **Why**: Prevents over-betting when the model is uncertain, and allows for aggressive compounding only when edge is statistically significant.

### 6.3 Volatility-Weighted Buffer
- **Volatility Multiplier**: Position size is dampened by a rolling 95th percentile volatility multiplier:
  $$ \xi_t = \frac{\sigma^{(95)}_t}{\text{Median}_{30d}(\sigma^{(95)})} $$
  $$ f_t^{base} = \frac{\tilde{f}_t}{1 + \xi_t} $$
- **Why**: Prevents over-sizing during periods of elevated tail volatility, protecting against fat-tail risk.

### 6.4 Conditional Martingale Escalation
- **Logic**: Position compounding (pyramiding) is only allowed when both edge is positive and posterior probability exceeds a high-confidence threshold (e.g., $p > 0.97$):
  $$ f_t = \min(c^k f_t^{base}, f_{max}) $$
  where $k$ is the streak of trades in the same direction, $c > 1$ is the pyramiding multiplier.
- **Why**: Only increases risk when the model is "on a roll" and edge is proven, avoiding path dependence and gambler's ruin.

### 6.5 Stochastic Drawdown Barrier
- **OU Process**: A stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is used to throttle risk when equity decays:
  $$ D_{t+1} = \mu + (D_t - \mu) e^{-\theta \Delta t} + \eta \sqrt{\frac{1 - e^{-2\theta \Delta t}}{2\theta}} \varepsilon_t $$
  If drawdown exceeds the barrier, all future $f_t$ are scaled down by $\gamma < 1$ until recovery.
- **Why**: Provides a mathematically sound, adaptive brake on risk during drawdowns, preventing catastrophic loss.

### 6.6 Combined Position Sizing Logic
- The final position size is the minimum of:
  - Kelly-based size (with Bayesian shrinkage)
  - Volatility-adjusted size
  - Martingale-adjusted size (if allowed)
  - Drawdown-throttled size (if in drawdown)
  - Hard caps (max leverage, max position size, max VaR)
- All calculations are performed in real time, using the latest model confidence, volatility, and account state.

### 6.7 Why This Is Superior
- **Adaptive**: Risk is always proportional to edge and adapts to changing market conditions.
- **Robust**: Protects against over-betting, fat tails, and drawdown spirals.
- **Compounding**: Allows for aggressive growth when edge is real, but shrinks risk when uncertainty or volatility is high.
- **Mathematically Sound**: Based on proven principles from information theory, stochastic processes, and modern risk management.
